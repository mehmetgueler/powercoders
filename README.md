## üìù  About This Project

This website was specifically designed as part of my application for the Powercoders bootcamp. My primary goal was to modify an existing recipe website to demonstrate my foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

When considering how to add an original and playful touch to this project, images of vegetables came to mind. It was the pumpkin that sparked my inspiration, naturally leading me to the theme of Halloween. So, I decided to transform the site into a collection of Halloween-themed recipes. This approach allowed me to practice structuring content, applying creative styles, and integrating interactive elements, all while staying true to the spirit of your exercise.

## ü§ñ AI Assistance
To overcome specific technical challenges and streamline my development process, I leveraged the assistance of artificial intelligence tools:

*Gemini and DeepSeek: These models were invaluable in refining my understanding and implementation of complex CSS concepts, particularly for CSS Grid and box-shadows. Their help was crucial in resolving specific challenges and enhancing the site's visual appeal.

*They were also utilized for text generation, including assistance with certain parts of English translation for the content, which allowed me to focus more on the technical development and overall structure of the website.
